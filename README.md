To operate Process Scheduling :

Run Process Scheduling/databases_automation.py as a python file from terminal

Once operated it will run indefinitely, calling databases at regular interval of time.

Process Scheduling/records.txt stores time for when a particular operation from databases_automation.py is called.

To stop execution of the file, hit Ctrl+C on terminal.

No need to run db operations from views.py file.

To automate Scheduling/databases_automation.py needs to be initiated once. Then it will self sustain.
